## Introduction
This is a Node.js application that provides API endpoints for creating users, adding friends, creating thoughts, and reacting to thoughts. The app uses Express.js as the web framework, Mongoose as the ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB, and MongoDB as the database.

The API endpoints are organized into routes for users, friends, thoughts, and reactions. Each route has its own set of endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the corresponding resource.

Overall, the social-networks app provides a useful example of how to build a back-end for a social network using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB, with functionality for users to create and manage their own content, as well as interact with content created by others.
